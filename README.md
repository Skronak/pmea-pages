Rules:
X players launch the game using the same seed.
1 player choose the inspector roles, the others choose the witness role. Among the witnesses one will be designated by the app as the culprit.
All the players will now choose a case/date and select it on their app.
The inspector will then proceed to interrogate each player for 2min, each players will have to add the 3 word visible on the app on their testimony. The culprit will have different word.
